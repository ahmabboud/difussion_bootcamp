    "# Train on synthetic data, test on real data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we go over the implementation and evaluation of training downstream models using synthetic data generated by TSDiff. Diffusion models have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various generative modeling tasks across different domains. Traditional approaches in time series diffusion models often focus on conditional models tailored for specific tasks such as forecasting or imputation. However, we explore the potential of task-agnostic, unconditional diffusion models for broader time series applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "TSDiff is an unconditionally-trained diffusion model designed for time series data. A key feature of TSDiff is its self-guidance mechanism, which allows it to conditionally perform various downstream tasks during inference without requiring any changes to the training process or additional auxiliary networks. This capability makes TSDiff highly versatile and effective across different time series tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes step-by-step instructions and code for running TSDiff experiments, generating synthetic data, and training downstream models using this synthetic data. By the end of this notebook, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage TSDiff for generating high-quality synthetic time series data and how to evaluate its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by setting up the environment and defining the necessary configurations for running our experiments."
