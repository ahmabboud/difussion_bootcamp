    "Two challenges regarding the extention of diffusion models to tabular data are:\n",
    "1. **Diverse data types:** a single table can have different columns each containing data of different types, including numerical, categorical, text, etc.\n",
    "2. **Varied distributions:** the distribution of data under different columns in a single table varry widely from column to column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TabSyn** addresses these challenges by introducing a latent space where tabular data of all columns are jointly represented. It then proceedes to train a diffusion model on the latent representations.\n",
    "This tactic allows TabSyn to:\n",
    "1. Train a single diffusion model for all data types in the dataset (i.e. Generality).\n",
    "2. Optimize the distribution of latent embeddings to facilitate training of the subsequent diffusion model, thus generating higher quality synthetic data (i.e. Quality).\n",
    "3. Require much fewer reverse steps during training of the diffusion model, and synthesize data faster (i.e. Speed).\n",
