    "Directly applying diffusion models to general tabular problems can be challenging because data points are typically represented by vectors of heterogeneous features. The inherent heterogeneity of tabular data complicates accurate modeling, as individual features can vary widely in nature; some may be continuous, while others are discrete. In this notebook, we explore **TabDDPM** — a diffusion model that can be universally applied to tabular datasets and effectively handles both categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary focus in this work is synthetic data generation, which is in high demand for many tabular tasks. Firstly, tabular datasets are often limited in size, unlike vision or NLP problems where large amounts of additional data are readily available online. Secondly, properly generated synthetic datasets do not contain actual user data, thus avoiding GDPR-like regulations and allowing for public sharing without compromising anonymity.\n",
